# node-nuke

Destroys all Node's API.

- If you want to embrace functional programming, this package will remove all ability to do side-effects.
- If you want to run Node as a headless [`d8`](https://v8.dev/docs/d8).
- If you are writing a Node clone like [`bamboo`](https://github.com/streamich/bamboo) and you want to
  verify that you are actually recreating the whole API.
